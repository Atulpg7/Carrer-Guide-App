Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed.

Likewise, information about the products you purchase might be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by other individuals or organizations. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires. We might share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, such as helping us better understand and improve our services, and for advertising and marketing purposes."/>
